# Personal-Finance-Manager


Description:
The Finance Manager App is a Java application built for personal financial management. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to track their income and expenses, visualize spending patterns, and view a summary of their financial activities.

Key Features:

Add new transactions: Users can add income or expense transactions, specifying the category, amount, and date.
Dynamic transaction management: Utilizes ObservableList and TableView to dynamically display and manage transaction data.
Expense visualization: Integrates a PieChart to visually represent expense categories and their corresponding amounts.
Summary view: Displays a summary of total income, total expenses, and net income, providing users with an overview of their financial status.
Input validation: Implements input validation for transaction amount and date fields to ensure data integrity.
Exception handling: Gracefully handles user input errors and prevents application crashes through robust exception handling mechanisms.
This project aims to provide users with a convenient tool for managing their personal finances effectively, helping them make informed financial decisions and achieve their financial goals.
